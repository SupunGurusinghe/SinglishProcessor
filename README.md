<h3>Main Objective</h3>
<p>The main objective of the research is to develop a comprehensive Sinhala and Singlish text cleaning and preprocessing library that can be used for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text summarization and news article generation.</p><br>

<h2>Research Questions</h2>
<p>The problem of cleaning and preprocessing semi-structured and unstructured data is becoming increasingly relevant as more and more organizations generate and collect vast amounts of this type of data. The aim of this research is to develop a Sinhala and Singlishtext (Type of unstructured data) cleaning and preprocessing library that can be used for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text summarization and news article generation. </p>
<p>The Sinhala language is the mother tongue of the majority of the Sri Lankan population, while Singlish is a colloquial language that mixes Sinhala and English words. Sinhala text cleaning and preprocessing are crucial steps for NLP tasks as they can improve the quality of data and the performance of algorithms.</p>
<p>However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive Sinhala and Singlish text cleaning and preprocessing libraries, which makes it difficult for researchers and developers to work on NLP tasks involving Sinhala and Singlish texts. In addition, there are challenges in Sinhalatext preprocessing due to the complex structure of the Sinhala language and the lack of resources for Sinhala NLP.</p><br>

<h2>Individual Research Question</h2>
<h4>Sameera W.G.G.A.S - IT20146924</h4>
<p>Singlish to Sinhala language conversion systems is still in their early stages of development, as indicated by recent studies [4][5]. While there have been several attempts to develop Singlish to Sinhala language conversion tools, most of them rely on rule-based approaches and do not support different variations of Singlish, making them less effective in handling the nuances and complexities of the Singlish language. As a result, there is a need for further research in this area to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Singlish to Sinhala language conversion systems.</p>
<p>One major limitation of existing tools is the lack of support for machine learning-based approaches. Although rule-based approaches have been successful in handling simple phrases, they lack the ability to handle complex phrases and variations of Singlish. In contrast, machine learning-based approaches can potentially overcome these limitations by capturing underlying patterns and relationships in the data. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning-based approaches for language conversion tasks [8][9], yet there has been limited research on applying these techniques to Singlish to Sinhala language conversion.</p>
<p>Another limitation of existing tools is the lack of integration with other systems, which is essential for real-world applications. For instance, businesses and government agencies may need to integrate language conversion tools into their existing systems to improve communication with their clients or customers. However, most existing tools do not provide such integration options, which limits their potential for wider adoption.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the user interface design of existing tools can be improved to provide a more user-friendly and intuitive experience. A good user interface can enhance the usability and accessibility of the tool, making it easier for users to interact with and obtain the desired output.</p>
<p>Finally, code reusability and modularity are important aspects of any software development project. Existing tools often lack these qualities, making it difficult for developers to reuse the code or modify it to fit their specific needs.</p>
<p>To address these limitations and gaps in the literature, this project aims to develop a Python data cleaning and preprocessing library for Singlish text to Sinhala language conversion that utilizes machine learning techniques. The library will provide support for different variations of Singlish, real-time conversion, and integration with other systems. Additionally, a user-friendly interface and code modularity will be prioritized in the development process.</p>

<p>The Sinhala language presents several challenges to language processing, including complex grammar, lack of standardization, and the absence of a significant amount of Sinhala language resources, such as text corpora and language models. These challenges have made it difficult to develop efficient and reliable solutions for Sinhala language processing.</p>
<p>Existing tools and techniques for Sinhala language processing are limited and often fail to accurately convert speech to text or written text to speech. For example, the tools available for Sinhala speech-to-text conversion are not capable of handling the language's complex grammar rules. As a result, the transcribed text often lacks proper grammar, which makes it difficult to use in various applications such as language learning and transcription for media.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a lack of tools available for converting verbal text to written text in Sinhala language. While some tools exist for written text-to-speech conversion, there are currently no tools available that accurately convert verbal text to written text while adhering to Sinhala language's specific grammar rules. This limitation presents a significant obstacle for news and article writers who require accurate and efficient conversion of verbal text to written Sinhala format.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the current tools and techniques available for Sinhala language processing lack flexibility and customization, making them unsuitable for use in different applications. Many of the existing tools and techniques are not optimized for real-time performance, which limits their use in applications that require quick and accurate processing.</p>
<p>Therefore, the research problem addressed by this project is the lack of an efficient and reliable solution for Sinhala language processing, including accurate and proper grammar Sinhala speech-to-text conversion and verbal text to written text conversion. This research problem presents a significant obstacle for various industries such as media, education, and technology, which require efficient and reliable language processing tools to develop new products and services and improve their operations.</p>
<p>The proposed Sinhala Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Library aims to address this research problem by providing an efficient and reliable solution for Sinhala language processing. The library will utilize machine learning and deep learning models such as neural networks to accurately convert Sinhala speech to text and convert that text to written Sinhala format while adhering to the language's specific grammar rules. Additionally, the library will be modular and pipeline-based, providing flexibility and customization, and will be optimized for real-time performance.</p>

<p>The field of natural language processing (NLP) has been rapidly advancing, with significant contributions made to various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and information retrieval. However, the development of NLP tools and techniques has been primarily focused on languages with a similar morphological structure to English, making them less effective in dealing with languages with complex structures such as Sinhala. Sinhala is a highly inflected language, with a rich morphology and complex grammatical structure that poses unique challenges for NLP tasks. Although there has been a growing interest in developing NLP tools and techniques for Sinhala, existing tools and libraries for Sinhala language processing have limitations that hinder their effectiveness in cleaning and preprocessing Sinhala text data.</p>
<p>One of the primary research problems in the field of Sinhala language processing is the lack of a comprehensive and efficient solution for data cleaning and preprocessing of Sinhala text data. Although several tools and libraries for Sinhala text processing exist, including Sinhala NLP, Sinling, A Rule Based Stemmer for Sinhala Language (research paper), PySinhala, and SinhalaTokenizer, there are still several limitations in these tools that hinder their effectiveness in cleaning and preprocessing Sinhala text data.</p>
<p>One significant limitation of existing tools is the lack of support for different variations of Sinhala text, which is a critical requirement for effective language processing. Although some tools, such as SinhalaTokenizer and the proposed research, support different variations of Sinhala text, existing tools such as Sinhala NLP, Sinling, A Rule Based Stemmer for Sinhala Language, and PySinhala do not provide this feature. This limitation makes it difficult for researchers and developers to use these tools for specific Sinhala language processing tasks.</p>
<p>Another significant research problem is the lack of integration with other systems, which limits the effectiveness of existing tools in real-world applications. Although the proposed research addresses this limitation by providing integration with other systems, existing tools such as Sinhala NLP, Sinling, PySinhala, and SinhalaTokenizer do not offer this feature. This limitation can be a significant challenge for developers looking to use these tools for larger- scale applications.</p>
<p>Another research problem is the lack of machine learning-based approaches, which can provide a more accurate and efficient solution for Sinhala language processing tasks. Although the proposed research addresses this limitation by incorporating machine learning-based approaches, existing tools such as Sinhala NLP, Sinling, A Rule Based Stemmer for Sinhala Language, PySinhala, and SinhalaTokenizer do not offer this feature. This limitation can limit the effectiveness of these tools in tasks such as sentiment analysis and machine translation.</p>
<p>Existing tools also lack the ability to handle large texts, with limited support for large text datasets. Although proposed research provides support for large text datasets, existing tools such as Sinhala NLP, Sinling, PySinhala, and SinhalaTokenizer have limited support for large text datasets. This limitation can be a significant challenge for researchers and developers working on tasks that require the processing of large amounts of text data.</p>
<p>In terms of user interface (UI) design, existing tools such as Sinhala NLP, Sinling have basic user interfaces and PySinhala, and SinhalaTokenizer don’t have UI which can limit their ease of use for researchers and developers. The proposed research aims to address this limitation by providing a user-friendly and customizable interface.</p>
<p>Lastly, existing tools lack comprehensive support for accurate and flexible processing of Sinhala text data.</p>

<p>A growing need for effective summarization and translation tools that can assist users in swiftly accessing and comprehending the most pertinent information has been generated by the development of online news content in the Sinhala language. There is a substantial research vacuum in the area of Sinhala text summarization as a result of the breadth and functionality limitations of previous studies. This work tries to address these constraints by presenting a comprehensive and customized Sinhala Text Summarization Library for News Articles.</p>
<p>There is now a lot of study on extractive approaches or particular methods like phrase compression in Sinhala text summarizing. Although these methods have advantages, they might not always result in summaries that are clear and simple. By reframing the source material rather than just extracting sentences, abstractive summarization approaches can help get over these constraints.</p>
<p>Creating a Sinhala Text Summarization Library that successfully blends extractive and abstractive summarization techniques to provide high-quality summaries is the research topic in this area. By ensuring that generated summaries accurately transmit the most important information while keeping readability and coherence, this library should solve the inadequacies of current research.</p>
<p>The ability for users to choose the lengths and formats of summaries is currently lacking in Sinhala text summarization research. This restriction limits the usefulness of the existing summary technologies because different users may need summaries of different lengths and styles.</p>
<p><p>The goal of this project is to create a library for Sinhala text summarizing that offers a variety of customized summary choices. Users should be able to choose the lengths and forms of their preferred summaries using this library, allowing for a wide range of user needs and preferences.</p>
<p>Existing studies do not address the challenge of summarizing multiple news articles on the same topic. Multi-document summarization is crucial for users seeking a comprehensive understanding of a subject, as it enables them to aggregate information from multiple sources.</p>
<p>The research problem in this context is to develop a Sinhala Text Summarization and Translation Library that incorporates multi-document summarization capabilities. The library should be able to generate coherent and non-redundant summaries from multiple news articles, providing users with a holistic understanding of the topic at hand.</p>
<p>None of the existing research in Sinhala text summarization includes translation capabilities. This limitation restricts the accessibility of Sinhala news content for a global audience, as users who do not understand the language cannot benefit from the summarized information.</p>
<p>The research problem, in this case, is to develop a Sinhala Text Summarization and Translation Library that integrates translation features. This library should enable users to convert summaries into other languages according to their preference, thereby enhancing the accessibility of Sinhala news content for a wider audience.</p><br>
